# Capstone-Project-Management-System
The end result of the Capstone Project Database System is a well-organized management system that handles all aspects of the Capstone projects for students. 

This system is designed in a way that only the Coordinator has full access to perform all Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for projects, faculty, and students since they are responsible for managing all information related to the Capstone projects.

On the other hand, the Guide/Mentor can only view their own projects and information of the students for each project, without having any other access. 

Finally, students can only view the student table that contains the details of their teammates and marks for reviews.


In addition, a future scope of this project is to develop an average calculating column for all the reviews. 
This feature would help to calculate the average of all the reviews given by the panel members, and provide a comprehensive view of the overall performance of the Capstone projects.
